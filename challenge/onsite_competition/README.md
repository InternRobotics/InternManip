# 🧭 IROS On-site Challenge

Welcome to the **IROS 2025 Challenge — Track: Vision-Language Manipulation in Open Tabletop Environments**!  
In this phase, participants’ models will be deployed on **a real robot** to evaluate performance in real-world conditions.

---
Based on the [guidelines](../guidelines.md) from the previous online competition, we enhanced the dataset by incorporating real-world training data and provided example scripts for both training and testing.

## 📦 Real-World Training Data Supplement
The data remains in the same Hugging Face repository used for the online competition. Please download the data following the instructions in [Prepare dataset](../guidelines.md#prepare-train--validation-dataset).  
> Note that a new folder named `train_real` has been added under `./data/dataset/IROS-2025-Challenge-Manip/`.

## 🛠️ Train
Based on the previous training tutorial in [Train](../guidelines.md#train), we have added an example [configuration file](../../run_configs/train/gr00t_n1_5_arx_iros.yaml) for training the `gr00t n1.5` on real-world datasets, provided as a reference.

You can use the following command to start the training.
```bash
torchrun --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 8 scripts/train/train.py --config run_configs/train/gr00t_n1_5_arx_iros.yaml
```

## ✅ Evaluation (WIP)


## 📋 Rules
Please check out the [onsite competition rules](./onsite_competition_rules_en-US.md).


## 🚀 Code Submission (WIP)
Submit a Docker image with your agent server preconfigured and ready to run. During the competition, the robot will connect to a local server over the network. We’ll share additional details soon.
